### WARNING: THIS IS JUST FOR TESTING PURPOSES, DON'T EXPECT A FULLY STABLE BUILD.

By initializing the repo with this source, you're completely acknowledge that you're on your own.

### Guide

To initialize your local repository, use this command:

	repo init -u https://github.com/Bootleggers-BrokenLab/manifest.git -b sambun

Then, be sure to add your device manifest in your local_manifests folder and finally, do:

	repo sync --current-branch --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags --optimized-fetch --prune -jx
	(the x on jx it's the amount of cores you have)

Also, just in case something went wrong for our side, or from your manifest or whatever, just add a `-q` in your repo sync command to see less lines and get into the issue more easily.

### Let's start building

When everything is done, be sure to shishufy your device (prepare it with the bootleg_device.mk file and bootleg_device product and stuff, that basic thing) and then when you're ready you can:

	source build/envsetup.sh
	lunch bootleg_device-userdebug
	mka bacon -jxxxxx
	
	(where it says device, it's your device codename. And you can use mka bacon ~~or mka bootleg~~, it's all up to you.)


Also, as another sidenote: This is explained on the updater-script but just to clarify: Unshishufied builds are UNOFFICIAL.


### Help from other devices

If you got some commits missing for us, let us know on our telegram chat. Everything else, it's up to you at the time of building.
